Readme: FullStack Course - Project Three: Shopping List Management

Welcome to the third project in the Polestack course! This project is a functional simulation of a server-client system that allows users to manage shopping lists. The application is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and follows the Single Page Application (SPA) architecture.

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to create a shopping list management system where users can perform the following actions:

1. Create a new shopping list.
2. Add products to a shopping list.
3. Delete products from a shopping list.
4. Delete an existing shopping list.

The communication between the client and the server will be simulated using JavaScript communication mechanisms. The server simulation will handle incoming requests from the client and use a simulation of a local database to manage the shopping list information.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML: Markup language for building the web pages.
- CSS: Styling language used to design the user interface.
- JavaScript: Programming language for implementing client-side functionality and communication with the server.
- SPA Architecture: The application follows the Single Page Application architecture for smooth user experience and seamless navigation.
